These header files contain classes used as datatypes.
These header classes are used to hold data by the user (unlike iostream), but they are not container classes.
But the data held is not a buffer or lookup table (unlike eku\math\dynprimebuff.h)
These classes merely abstract a datatype and offer member functions that operate on them.
These classes do not use an interface or API (unlike eku\windows\UIclass\)
